# jQuery Playground

I'm learning JavaScript and jQuery. [Here](http://mfcovington.github.io/jquery-playground/index.html) are some of my mini projects for learning from tutorials, etc.

## Simple Lightbox

I learned how to make a [simple lightbox](http://mfcovington.github.io/jquery-playground/lightbox/) in Treehouse's [jQuery Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/jquery-basics/creating-a-simple-lightbox/) course.

## Mobile Dropdown Menu

I learned how to make a [mobile dropdown menu](http://mfcovington.github.io/jquery-playground/mobile-dropdown/) in Treehouse's [jQuery Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/jquery-basics/creating-a-mobile-drop-down-menu/) course. Change the width of the window to switch between the mobile and non-mobile menu versions.

## Password Confirmation Form

I learned how to make a [password confirmation form](http://mfcovington.github.io/jquery-playground/password-confirmation/) in Treehouse's [jQuery Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/jquery-basics/creating-a-password-confirmation-form/) course.

## Simple Drawing App

I learned how to make a [simple drawing app](http://mfcovington.github.io/jquery-playground/draw/) in Treehouse's [jQuery Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/jquery-basics/creating-a-simple-drawing-application/) course.

## Fading List

I was thinking about the CSS pseudo-selectors `:nth-child` and `:nth-of-type` and how they can be used to style list in cool ways. It made me start thinking about more complex list style patterns. I started playing around with JavaScript and made what I'm calling a [fading list](http://mfcovington.github.io/jquery-playground/fading-list/).
